            "question": "How to make an appointment?",
            "answer": " To book an appointment, you would typically need to contact the healthcare facility directly. Look for contact information on their official website or any official correspondence you have received from them. If you have a specific department or service in mind, their direct contact details may also be available on the website. If you are a new patient, you might need to provide some personal and medical information during the booking process. If you are an existing patient, you may be able to book an appointment through a patient portal if the facility offers one."
