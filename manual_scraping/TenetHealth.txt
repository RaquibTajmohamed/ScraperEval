Responding to COVID-19
Tenet Healthcare has been on the front lines of community-based prevention and patient care since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our teams have responded to this public health emergency with strength and perseverance. They have continued to adapt to ensure the best possible outcomes for our patients and protect our medical staff and employees.

Infectious diseases are something we manage daily. Tenet has continued to collaborate closely with state and county-level Departments of Public Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to respond to COVID-19 cases and care for all patients. We have strong infection control policies, procedures and systems in place to keep our extended communities safe.

Every day, our front-line team members manage adversity and provide quality, compassionate care. They lead by example and do what they have been called upon and trained to do with honor and professionalism. We are deeply grateful for their selfless courage and dedication to saving lives.

We also want to recognize the heroic efforts of all healthcare professionals around the world who have responded to COVID-19.

Additional resources on COVID-19 are outlined below, and please see our locations for information on our local response efforts.

Who We Are
We are a community built on care. Our caregivers and supporting staff extend compassion to those in need, helping to improve the health and well-being of those we serve, and provide comfort and healing. Your community is our community.

 

TenetMap

Our Story
We started out as a small operation in California. In May 1969, we acquired four hospitals, some additional care facilities and real estate for the future development of hospitals. Over the years, we’ve grown tremendously in size, scope and capability, building a home in new markets over time, and curating those homes to provide a compassionate environment for those entrusting us with their care.

We have a rich history at Tenet. There are so many stories of compassionate care; so many “firsts” in terms of medical innovation; so many examples of advancing healthcare delivery and shaping a business that is truly centered around patients and community need. Tenet and our predecessors have enabled us to touch many different elements of healthcare and make a difference in the lives of others.

Read more about Tenet through the years.
Our Impact Today
Today, we are a leading health system and services platform that continues to evolve. Tenet’s operations include three businesses – USPI, our hospitals and physicians and Conifer Health Solutions. You can learn more about each business here.

Our impact spreads far and deep with more than 480 ambulatory surgery centers and surgical hospitals, 58 hospitals and approximately 160 additional outpatient centers and other sites of care. We are differentiated by our top notch medical specialists and service lines that are tailored within each community we serve. The work Conifer is doing will help provide the foundation for better health for clients across the country, through the delivery of healthcare-focused revenue cycle management and value-based care solutions.

Diversity & Inclusion
One of our core values is embracing inclusiveness for all people in our workplace and in the communities we serve. It is an active part of how we operate. We focus on cultivating a culture where everyone belongs and feels valued, and where respect and equal treatment are the cornerstones of every interaction.

di-efforts-309x304Our D&I efforts are guided by the leadership of our Diversity Council and employee resource group (ERG) sponsors, along with support from Tenet’s Board of Directors and executive management. The Council and ERG sponsors are a diverse group of leaders who represent different parts of our business. They live and work in communities around the country, such as El Paso, Detroit, Palm Beach, Tucson, and North Texas.

Our D&I efforts prioritize the following:

A workforce and talent pipeline that reflects the communities we serve;
A leadership team that is comprised of and elevates underrepresented groups;
Training, education, and engagement to proactively address the best ways to nurture an inclusive and diverse culture; and,
A top-down, bottom-up approach to ensure active involvement from leadership and employees across the enterprise.
Tenet is an Equal Opportunity Employer. We embrace the diversity of our co-workers, physicians, suppliers, patients and everyone we serve. We do not tolerate harassment or discrimination on the basis of race, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, national origin, age, disability, veteran status or any other characteristic protected by law. We also are committed to providing accommodations to employees who have qualified physical or mental disabilities.

Depicted in the picture is vice president Dallas Riddle with a model of the expanded medical complex under construction in Modesto, California.

Improving our Impact on the Environment
In caring for the long-term health of our communities, we are committed to doing our part to protect the planet for generations to come. We recognize the need to integrate a sustainability mindset into our culture. That includes clarity around sustainability goals and standards, proper coordination and accountability through reporting.

Building a sustainable future starts with all of us. As we focus on four key areas (carbon, waste, water, and sustainable procurement), we are building programs to address top priorities across our value chain. Some of those include expanding integrated waste management, streamlining methods for electronic waste disposal, the conversion and use of LED lighting and partnerships to increase the sustainability of our supply chain.

Giving Back: Global in Scope, Local at Heart
We like to say that we are global in scope, but local at heart. While we have a vast footprint, each of our care facilities gives back to its local community in different ways. Our charitable contributions and community initiatives support a diverse education pipeline, victims of natural disasters and tragedies, veterans, children suffering from food insecurity and so much more.

food bank
Each year, we provide free screenings at local health fairs, host educational seminars and search for ways to better serve the people in our communities. That also means we organize countless events on our hospital campuses and care centers to bring our communities together. For National Volunteer Month, Tenet, USPI and Conifer employees donate their time to support a variety of organizations. We also work together year-round to save lives through Annual Blood Drives. Thanks to the generosity of our colleagues, physicians, volunteers and neighbors, we replenish local blood banks across the country.

donated cereal boxes
One of our most engaging and impactful initiatives is our annual Healthy Over Hungry Cereal Drive®. Every June, employees across the enterprise collect donations of cereal to help support families struggling with hunger. The Cereal Drive was launched in 2010 at Children’s Hospital of Michigan, a Tenet hospital which is part of the Detroit Medical Center. The goal was to collect much needed food for families and to promote the importance of eating a healthy breakfast, especially for children in the summer months. The program was so successful, we later expanded it across the Tenet network.

USPI employees at blood drive
Through its annual “Seasons of Gratitude” program, USPI invites colleagues across the country to participate in activities that demonstrate gratitude for each other and their communities. Employees spearhead projects or activities that support local organizations meaningful to their team.

Team Malasakit
Team Malasakit is the Tenet Global Business Center’s corporate social responsibility arm, made up of 70 employee volunteers. They coordinate numerous activities to benefit their local communities in and around Manila. The word “malasakit” in Filipino means to “care for something or someone like it were one’s own,” a term that mirrors our mission to deliver quality, compassionate care in the communities we serve.

education initiatives
Our enterprise is also passionate about supporting education initiatives. With organizations such as the Baptist Health Foundation, the Tenet Healthcare Foundation collaborates to provide scholarships to educate tomorrow’s healthcare leaders and providers. We also proudly support the UNCF, which helps to advance opportunities for minority students in pursuit of a higher education.

Tenet Care Fund logo
We make a concerted effort to give back to our own employees who give so much to their patients and communities. The Tenet Care Fund is a 501(c) (3) public charity that provides financial assistance to employees who have experienced hardship due to events beyond their control, including natural disasters, extended illnesses or injuries, and the unprecedented impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Care Fund enables employees to make donations that benefit fellow team members in need.

What We Do
Our four operating segments include United Surgical Partners International (USPI), our hospital segment, Conifer Health Solutions, and our shared services the Global Business Center. Our team members in each business are united by a commitment to deliver quality compassionate care, while also providing the support system for those who do.

THIS NOTICE DESCRIBES HOW MEDICAL INFORMATION ABOUT YOU MAY BE USED AND DISCLOSED AND HOW YOU CAN GET ACCESS TO THIS INFORMATION.  PLEASE REVIEW IT CAREFULLY.
Who Presents this Notice

The references to "Facility” and “Health Professionals” in this notice refer to the members of the Tenet Healthcare Affiliated Covered Entity. An Affiliated Covered Entity (ACE) is a group of organizations under common ownership or control who designate themselves as a single Affiliated Covered Entity for purposes of compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ("HIPAA"). The Facility, its employees, workforce members and members of the ACE who are involved in providing and coordinating health care are all bound to follow the terms of this Notice of Privacy Practices ("Notice"). The members of the ACE will share PHI with each other for the treatment, payment and health care operations of the ACE and as permitted by HIPAA and this Notice. For a complete list of the members of the ACE, please contact the Privacy & Security Compliance Office.

Privacy Obligations

Each Facility is required by law to maintain the privacy of your health information ("Protected Health Information" or "PHI") and to provide you with this Notice of legal duties and privacy practices with respect to your Protected Health Information.  The Facility uses computerized systems that may subject your Protected Health Information to electronic disclosure for purposes of treatment, payment and/or health care operations as described below. When the Facility uses or discloses your Protected Health Information, we are required to abide by the terms of this Notice (or other notice in effect at the time of the use or disclosure).

Notifications

The Facility is required by law to protect the privacy of your medical information, distribute this Notice of Privacy Practices to you, and follow the terms of this Notice. The Facility is also required to notify you if there is a breach or impermissible access, use or disclosure of your medical information.

Permissible Uses and Disclosures Without Your Written Authorization

In certain situations your written authorization must be obtained in order to use and/or disclose your PHI.  However, the Facility and Health Professionals do not need any type of authorization from you for the following uses and disclosures:

Uses and Disclosures for Treatment, Payment and Health Care Operations.  Your PHI may be used and disclosed to treat you, obtain payment for services provided to you and conduct “health care operations” as detailed below:

Treatment.  Your PHI may be used and disclosed to provide treatment and other services to you--for example, to diagnose and treat your injury or illness.  In addition, you may be contacted to provide you appointment reminders or information about treatment alternatives or other health-related benefits and services that may be of interest to you.  Your PHI may also be disclosed to other providers involved in your treatment.  For example, a doctor treating you for a broken leg may need to know if you have diabetes because if you do, this may impact your recovery.

Payment.  Your PHI may be used and disclosed to obtain payment for services provided to you--for example, disclosures to claim and obtain payment from your health insurer, HMO, or other company that arranges or pays the cost of some or all of your health care (“Your Payor”) to verify that Your Payor will pay for health care.  The physician who reads your x-ray may need to bill you or your Payor for reading of your x-ray therefore your billing information may be shared with the physician who read your x-ray.

Health Care Operations.  Your PHI may be used and disclosed for health care operations, which include internal administration and planning and various activities that improve the quality and cost effectiveness of the care delivered to you.  For example, PHI may be used to evaluate the quality and competence of physicians, nurses and other health care workers.  PHI may be disclosed to the Privacy & Security Compliance Office in order to resolve any complaints you may have and ensure that you have a comfortable visit.  Your PHI may be provided to various governmental or accreditation entities such as the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations to maintain our license and accreditation.

Additionally, your PHI may be used or disclosed for the purpose of allowing students, residents, nurses, physicians and others who are interested in healthcare, pursuing careers in the medical field or desire an opportunity for an educational experience to tour, shadow employees and/or physician faculty members or engage in a clinical Practicum.

For example, information about your past medical care and current medical conditions and medications can be available to other primary care physicians if they participate in the Health Information Organization. Exchange of health information can provide faster access, better coordination of care and assist providers and public health officials in making more informed treatment decisions. You may opt out of the Health Information Organization and prevent providers from being able to search for your information through the exchange.

Giving Back: Global in Scope, Local at Heart
We like to say that we are global in scope, but local at heart. While we have a vast footprint, each of our care facilities gives back to its local community in different ways. Our charitable contributions and community initiatives support a diverse education pipeline, victims of natural disasters and tragedies, veterans, children suffering from food insecurity and so much more.

food bank
Each year, we provide free screenings at local health fairs, host educational seminars and search for ways to better serve the people in our communities. That also means we organize countless events on our hospital campuses and care centers to bring our communities together. For National Volunteer Month, Tenet, USPI and Conifer employees donate their time to support a variety of organizations. We also work together year-round to save lives through Annual Blood Drives. Thanks to the generosity of our colleagues, physicians, volunteers and neighbors, we replenish local blood banks across the country.

donated cereal boxes
One of our most engaging and impactful initiatives is our annual Healthy Over Hungry Cereal Drive®. Every June, employees across the enterprise collect donations of cereal to help support families struggling with hunger. The Cereal Drive was launched in 2010 at Children’s Hospital of Michigan, a Tenet hospital which is part of the Detroit Medical Center. The goal was to collect much needed food for families and to promote the importance of eating a healthy breakfast, especially for children in the summer months. The program was so successful, we later expanded it across the Tenet network.

USPI employees at blood drive
Through its annual “Seasons of Gratitude” program, USPI invites colleagues across the country to participate in activities that demonstrate gratitude for each other and their communities. Employees spearhead projects or activities that support local organizations meaningful to their team.

Team Malasakit
Team Malasakit is the Tenet Global Business Center’s corporate social responsibility arm, made up of 70 employee volunteers. They coordinate numerous activities to benefit their local communities in and around Manila. The word “malasakit” in Filipino means to “care for something or someone like it were one’s own,” a term that mirrors our mission to deliver quality, compassionate care in the communities we serve.

education initiatives
Our enterprise is also passionate about supporting education initiatives. With organizations such as the Baptist Health Foundation, the Tenet Healthcare Foundation collaborates to provide scholarships to educate tomorrow’s healthcare leaders and providers. We also proudly support the UNCF, which helps to advance opportunities for minority students in pursuit of a higher education.

Tenet Care Fund logo
We make a concerted effort to give back to our own employees who give so much to their patients and communities. The Tenet Care Fund is a 501(c) (3) public charity that provides financial assistance to employees who have experienced hardship due to events beyond their control, including natural disasters, extended illnesses or injuries, and the unprecedented impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Care Fund enables employees to make donations that benefit fellow team members in need.

Physician Careers
Our Community Built on Care comes to life with our caregivers. 

At Tenet Healthcare, we believe in fostering an environment that enables our physicians to focus on what matters most – providing compassionate care to the communities we serve. That care is supported by a strong foundation of highly trained and mission-driven team members, state-of-the-art medical equipment, medical expertise, and robust data and technology. 

Our footprint is expansive, allowing thousands of physicians the privilege to serve patients across the country. Whether you are just finishing your residency or fellowship training, or exploring ways to further your medical career, Tenet is proud to offer a wide range of opportunities to the medical community to advance our mission of providing quality, compassionate care.
